Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Bias toward caution over speed; for trivial tasks, use judgment. Merge with project-specific instructions as needed.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

- State assumptions explicitly; if uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them — don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop, name what's confusing, and ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked; no abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it. Would a senior engineer call it overcomplicated? Then simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting; don't refactor what isn't broken; match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- Remove imports/variables/functions YOUR changes orphaned — but don't delete pre-existing dead code; mention it instead.
- The test: every changed line traces directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

- Turn tasks into verifiable goals: "add validation" → write tests for invalid inputs, then pass them; "fix the bug" → write a reproducing test first; "refactor X" → tests pass before and after.
- For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan as `step → verify: check` lines.
- Strong criteria let you loop independently; weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

## 5. Testing Discipline

**E2E tests are the highest-priority signal. Cover the real user journey. Never silence failures.**

- Prioritize E2E over unit/integration when coverage is limited; design cases around the user's real path and don't skip steps.
- For any frontend UI, write E2E with **Playwright**, issuing requests to a **real backend API** — no stubbed network, fixture servers, or intercepted responses.
- Don't use mock data in E2E; run against real data and services. If mocking seems unavoidable, stop and get human confirmation first.
- Never skip, disable, or `.only` a test to go green — investigate the underlying bug instead.
- E2E tests must be **source-blind**: design assertions from scenario reasonableness alone, never by reading product source to pick expected values. The test verifies the observable contract, not the implementation.
- **If an E2E test fails, the default conclusion is a bug in the code, not the test.** Fix the product; don't weaken the assertion, relax the expected value, change the scenario, or read the source to explain it away. Only change a failing test if a human confirms the scenario is invalid.
- If a test case itself looks wrong, flag it and ask a human — don't silently delete or rewrite it.

## 6. Research Discipline

**Verify against primary sources. Never guess or infer product behavior.**

- Confirm details only via **official documentation** and **source code**; don't speculate or fill gaps with assumptions.
- If docs and source don't answer it, say so and ask — don't invent an answer.
- Cite the specific doc URL, file path, or commit/version for any claim about third-party behavior.

## 7. Reference Implementations Before Building

**Before implementing any feature, study how the established players did it — don't drift from the ecosystem.**

Before writing the first line of a new feature, read:

- **Mainstream AI gateway implementations** — research at least three established, mainstream AI gateways and study how each solves the problem. When in doubt about a request/response transform, read their sources for the same provider + endpoint and compare.
- **Upstream provider docs** — the authoritative spec for any endpoint: OpenAI <https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference>, Anthropic <https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api>, Gemini <https://ai.google.dev/api>, DeepSeek <https://api-docs.deepseek.com>, Bedrock <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/>.
- **Upstream SDK source** — the real contract when docs are vague (`usage` sub-fields, streaming event order, error envelopes): the official `openai-python`, `anthropic-sdk-python`, and `generative-ai-python` repos.

The rule:

- For any new endpoint, request transform, or response normalization, compare how at least three mainstream gateways approach it, cite one upstream-spec source, and summarize that comparison — plus where your design lands — in the design notes / PR description.
- If your design diverges from how those gateways solve it, name the divergence and justify it ("they do X but we need Y because of Z" — not "I didn't know they handled it").
- For any field, header, or status code you emit or parse, cite the upstream doc URL or SDK file/line. Don't invent names the ecosystem has already chosen.
- Refer to other products generically in shipped artifacts (code, comments, commit messages, PR descriptions) — describe the approach, not the brand. Keep brand-specific notes to internal design discussion.

## 8. Independent Audit Before Merge

**Every PR pushed must be reviewed by an independent audit agent. Merge is blocked until all HIGH/MEDIUM findings are resolved or explicitly justified.**

After every `gh pr create` or force-push, spawn a fresh `general-purpose` Agent with no shared context. Brief it cold with the PR URL and the contract the PR claims to pin. Treat each angle as blocking:

- **Correctness** — does it do what the description claims? Would a real regression fail the assertions?
- **Reliability** — races, error handling, retry/timeout, propagation timing on slow CI.
- **Security** — auth/authz, input validation at boundaries, injection, header forwarding (and what's deliberately not forwarded).
- **Sensitive-info leakage** — secrets in logs/errors, internal taxonomy or upstream-provider details in user-facing fields, tokens/PII in fixtures.
- **Breaking changes** — API shape, on-disk format, wire protocol, default shifts; if breaking, is it gated/versioned?
- **E2E coverage** — the user-visible contract, not just unit happy-path; mocks tight enough that a regression on the unverified side can't sneak through.

Output HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW per finding with **concrete suggested code**, not vague "consider". **Merge gate:** every HIGH and MEDIUM is either fixed in code or explicitly justified in the PR (e.g. "feature gap, filed as #N, agreed not to block"); silent merge is not enough. For findings that surface gateway/product-behavior gaps, file separate issues and link them. Self-review misses the author's blind spots — an independent agent catches them.

## PR Batching — One PR per Session by Default

This repo is developed end-to-end by agents — no human reviewer needs small review units — and CodeRabbit bills and rate-limits **per PR**. Fanning one effort into many small PRs burns review quota and stalls the session on throttled bot reviews. Keep ONE open PR per session and push follow-up and related work to it as additional commits (rule and doc riders included) instead of opening another. Split only when a fix must merge independently ahead of the batch, or when the user asks for separate delivery.

## Handler Families Stay in Lockstep — Fix the Whole Class

**The client-facing endpoint handlers come in families that share dispatch, auth, routing, telemetry, and guardrail logic — `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/messages` (+`count_tokens`), `/v1/responses`, plus embeddings/rerank/audio/images and the jobs surface (files/batches/fine-tuning). A bug or feature landed on one almost always applies to the others, and a gap on the unfixed siblings is SILENT: nothing errors, the behavior just quietly degrades.**

- When you touch a per-request mechanism (a runtime metric, a limit, an auth check, a usage emission, header threading), grep the offending call/pattern across the whole crate and wire **every** sibling path in the same PR — both streaming and non-streaming branches — or state explicitly in the PR which sibling is deferred and why, and file the follow-up issue immediately.
- "Documented follow-up" without an issue is how gaps rot: it lives in one PR description and no one ever comes back.
- **An emit function on `Metrics` with no caller is invisible to every check we run.** Its methods are `pub`, so dead-code analysis never fires; unit tests call it directly and pass; the only symptom is a series that never appears in a scrape, which is indistinguishable from "no traffic yet". A metric family is shipped when an **e2e asserts it in `GET /metrics`** after driving real traffic — not when `Metrics` can emit it. (Twice now: `record_proxy_request` until #888, then `record_deployment_request` + `record_routing_fallback` until #972.)
- Test coverage must include each wired endpoint, not just chat: an e2e that only drives `/v1/chat/completions` will stay green forever while Anthropic-SDK (`/v1/messages`) and Codex (`/v1/responses`) traffic silently misbehaves.
- Prefer hoisting the shared logic into one chokepoint (e.g. `resolve_attempt_models`) so the family can't drift again.

(Two recurrences of the same lesson: #471 — a Model-Group dispatch fix landed only on `/v1/messages` while `/v1/responses` and `count_tokens` had the identical gap; then #715 — `least_busy`'s in-flight counter shipped fed by chat.rs only (#684 left messages/responses as an un-filed "follow-up"), so the strategy silently degraded to declaration order for Claude Code / Codex traffic until #716. The EWMA for `least_latency` (#682) wired all three endpoints at once and never had this problem — that's the standard.)

## A Config Knob Isn't Shipped Until the Control Plane Exposes It

**A user-configurable data-plane feature is NOT delivered when the Rust side works — it's delivered when a user can reach it. DP-only is a half-feature nobody can turn on.**

In managed deployments users never write etcd directly; a **control plane** is the only writer, and it validates every resource before persisting it. So the moment you add a new config surface here — a new `RoutingStrategy` variant, a new per-target field, a new resource knob, a header-driven behavior a user is expected to configure — a gateway that happily reads it from etcd is still **unreachable** if the control plane rejects the field on the way in and no UI offers it.

- **Treat any PR that adds or extends a user-facing config surface as implying paired control-plane work.** Before calling a routing/resource/config feature complete, confirm the control plane can accept and persist the new shape.
- **"Done" for such a feature spans**: the control plane's resource schema and any generated bindings; its typed model, request validation, and etcd projection; its dashboard form field(s) plus i18n; and paired tests — cross-plane integration plus UI.
- **If you can only do the gateway half in this PR, say so and track the control-plane counterpart in the same breath** — never let the umbrella task close on gateway-only work. A merged gateway PR with no counterpart is a latent gap, not a shipped feature.
- The **standalone `resources_file` path is the exception**: it validates against `schemas/resources/*.schema.json` from this repo, so a new field is reachable there as soon as the schema is regenerated. That is why a field can work on a file-mode deployment while still being unreachable on a managed one — do not read "it works on my box" as "it shipped".
- Pure internal mechanics (a new algorithm with no user-set config, an observability metric, an internal refactor) don't need control-plane work — this rule is about **user-configurable** surfaces a customer must be able to set.

(Lesson from #873 routing: `least_cost` / `least_latency` / `least_busy`, per-target `tags`, and `sticky` canary all shipped gateway-only across #681/#682/#684/#686/#687 while the control plane still pinned the closed `[round_robin, weighted, failover]` enum and its dashboard had no fields — so none of it was usable until the matching integration landed. Same class, seen again in-repo: cache pricing fields were added and the console offered them while the deployed gateway binary still rejected them, because the *validator* had not moved with the *form*.)

## The Resource Model Is Canonical in schemas/resources

**When this repo and a control plane disagree about a resource field's name, enum values, or nesting, `schemas/resources/*.schema.json` wins — the control plane converges to it.**

This inverts the earlier rule, which made a vendor's spec authoritative. That made sense while the control plane was a separate product this repo could not change; it does not once the gateway and its control plane are developed together. The field shape is now defined once, here, and everything else is generated from or validated against it.

- Adding or renaming a user-facing resource field starts in the Rust model, then `cargo run -p aisix-core --bin dump-schema` regenerates `schemas/resources/`. The control plane consumes those files for request validation and form generation rather than carrying a hand-maintained copy — a second hand-maintained copy is exactly how the two drift.
- Renames converge with `#[serde(alias = "…")]` so stored documents and existing callers keep loading through the deprecation window; never hard-rename a shipped field in one step (an unreleased field with no consumers may rename outright, as #657 did).
- The historical divergence axes stay allowed where they reflect a genuine difference in deployment shape, not drift: reference style (names in the declarative file vs UUIDs over the wire), tenancy scoping (flat here vs org/environment in a multi-tenant control plane), and credential custody (`key_hash` in documents vs server-generated plaintext-once). `cost` is NO LONGER a control-plane-derived field — the gateway computes spend from `Model.cost`, including the prompt-cache rates, and a control plane that recomputes must use the same numbers.
- Why this direction: the schemas are generated from the implementation that actually enforces the field, so they cannot advertise something the gateway does not honour. The failure the old rule guarded against — #644, where a generated schema advertised `rps`/`rph` the validator rejected — is now impossible in that direction; the remaining risk is a control plane lagging the schema, which is a build-order problem with a mechanical fix (regenerate, then deploy validator before form).
## Model Kinds Stay in Lockstep — Two Identities, and the Sub-Dispatch Bypasses

**A Model is one table but five kinds (`direct` / `routing` / `ensemble` / `semantic` / `embedding`, plus wildcard display-name aliases), and every request carries TWO model identities: the caller-addressed entry (may be a virtual parent) and the dispatched target. For direct models they coincide, so a mechanism built and tested against direct models silently never decides the composite case — the most-repeated silent-bug class here (#962, #1087, #1237, #1267, #786).**

The five kinds are the cross-plane taxonomy (cp-admin.yaml `kind`); this repo's `model_one_of` implements four dispatch shapes, with `embedding` carried as the `embedding` block on the direct shape (`models/model.rs`). For a wildcard-served request three names are in play — the caller-minted alias, the wildcard row's `display_name`, and the concrete upstream model — and "caller-addressed entry" means the **resolved row** for the gate/metric family: inline rate-limit buckets, Prometheus metric labels, and health keys use the row's `display_name`, not the caller-minted string (#959). Usage-event attribution (`requested_model`) and `model_name` policy conditions intentionally keep the caller-supplied name.

- When you touch a model-keyed mechanism (a limit, a guard, an ACL, a config knob, usage/metric attribution, cache keying), answer in the doc comment: does it key on the **requested** entry, the **dispatched** target, or **both**, and what is the behavior for each of the six shapes.
- The per-target invariant (`crates/aisix-proxy/AGENTS.md`: "a per-model gate binds each target") is written around `resolve_attempt_models` — the routing-group trunk. **Ensemble panel/judge (`ProxyModelCaller::call`, the streaming judge) and semantic targets (`semantic::resolve`) bypass that trunk**, so a gate wired only into the trunk is silently absent there (the 2026-08 audit found member IP allowlist, health consumption, and retries all missing on the semantic path for exactly this reason — #958). A new per-target gate must be wired into the sub-dispatch paths too, or explicitly deferred with a filed issue. Prefer routing every dispatch through one shared chokepoint so the family can't drift.
- **Strict writes, lenient loads.** `model_one_of` has two variants: the **strict** schema (declarative resources file, the published `schemas/resources/model.schema.json`, every strict validator consumer) forbids a knob a kind never resolves — accepted-but-unread config is the #962 class; the **lenient** loader keeps the base XOR so stored rows written by an older build still load, with `Model::strip_kind_inapplicable` dropping the dead knob and reporting it as `inapplicable:<field>` through the partial-compat channel. The two lists MUST mirror each other exactly (strict-forbidden ⇔ lenient-stripped) — a field forbidden-but-not-stripped half-honors; stripped-but-not-forbidden vanishes on load while the write path accepts it. A knob is enforced exactly as written or rejected, never half-honored (#963).
- **`ensemble` is an experimental surface.** Its known parity gaps — member `allowed_cidrs`/guardrail/cooldown/health consumption, Prometheus token+spend attribution, response caching, parent-level generic knobs — are deliberate TODOs under a single future design pass. Do NOT piecemeal-fix one gap ahead of that pass, and do NOT re-audit them as fresh findings. (The one exception is a marshal-family or shared-chokepoint change where covering ensemble is a one-line parallel edit, e.g. projecting an entry-level field the DP already enforces.)
- Adding a NEW kind = sweeping every existing model-keyed mechanism against it (grep the kind predicates in `models/model.rs`; every hit re-answers the questions above).

## AISIX Product Terminology

Use the following terms in public prose, generated API descriptions, release
notes, and configuration comments:

- **AISIX AI Gateway** is the open-source product. Use **open-source AISIX
  gateway** when the distinction from AISIX Cloud matters; after establishing
  the product, use **AISIX gateway** or **gateway**.
- **AISIX Cloud** is the commercial product umbrella. **Hybrid Cloud** is its
  API7-hosted control-plane option, and **On-Premises** is its customer-hosted
  control-plane option. Do not present **AISIX Hybrid Cloud** or **AISIX
  On-Premises** as separate products.
- An AISIX gateway is a **data plane** only within AISIX Cloud architecture. Do
  not call an independently operated open-source gateway a data plane.
- Do not use **standalone gateway** as a product label. `standalone mode` and
  `managed mode` remain valid when describing runtime behavior.
- Avoid unqualified **self-hosted**. Name the component being operated, such as
  the open-source AISIX gateway, the On-Premises control plane, or a self-hosted
  upstream service.
- The Dashboard is the control plane's user interface, not the whole control
  plane. Live AI requests pass through the gateway directly and do not pass
  through the AISIX Cloud control plane or API7.

## Documentation Lives in api7/docs

**User-facing documentation is maintained in the `api7/docs` repository (published to <https://docs.api7.ai/ai-gateway/>), not in this repo.**

- This repo's source tree intentionally carries **no** user-facing doc pages — they were migrated to `api7/docs` so one site stays authoritative and never drifts from a stale in-repo copy. Do not add or keep prose docs under `docs/` here.
- When a feature needs documentation, add or update the page in `api7/docs` and link to its `docs.api7.ai` URL (e.g. from the README) — never re-introduce a `docs/*.md` page in this repo, even temporarily or "just for now".
- Only user-facing *prose* moves out. Code-level doc comments stay with the code — including the generated API reference below.

## Generated API Documentation

**Some source comments are rendered into user-facing API references.**

When editing Admin API resource models under `crates/aisix-core/src/models` or OpenAPI assembly in `crates/aisix-admin/src/openapi.rs`:

- Write descriptions as public API reference text, not internal implementation notes.
- Avoid internal shorthand such as DP, CP, kine row, wire shape, mock server, bridge dispatch, or issue-only context.
- Avoid excessive inline code. Use it only for exact field names, enum values, routes, headers, environment variables, and literal response values.
- Do not describe stable defaults only in prose. Expose them as OpenAPI `default` values when the runtime behavior has a fixed default.
- For computed fallback behavior, describe what happens when the field is omitted instead of calling it a schema default.
- Regenerate resource schemas with `cargo run -p aisix-core --bin dump-schema` after changing model comments.
- Verify the generated Admin API OpenAPI with `cargo run -p aisix-admin --bin dump-openapi > /tmp/admin-api.openapi.json` after changing Admin API routes, OpenAPI metadata, or generated descriptions.
- Preview or inspect the served OpenAPI when changing generated descriptions.

**Working if:** fewer unnecessary diff lines, fewer overcomplication rewrites, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.
