//! Pluggable counter backend behind the [`crate::Limiter`].
//!
//! The limiter itself only knows about *buckets* (an opaque key) and a
//! [`RateLimit`]; where the counters actually live is a [`RateStore`].
//!
//! - [`local::LocalStore`] keeps the historical per-process in-memory
//!   counters (a `DashMap` of fixed-window counters). This is the default
//!   and is behaviour-identical to the pre-#798 limiter.
//! - [`redis::RedisStore`] keeps the counters in a shared Redis so every
//!   DP replica in a cluster enforces ONE global window — the fix for
//!   api7/AISIX-Cloud#798, where N replicas multiplied every limit by N.
//!
//! Two phases mirror the limiter's contract:
//! - **acquire** (request path, async): concurrency gate + token
//!   check-only + request check-and-increment, all-or-nothing per bucket.
//! - **commit** (request path success, async): post-deduct token add +
//!   concurrency release.
//! - **release** / **add_tokens** (after-the-fact, sync): concurrency
//!   release on drop, and the streaming post-stream token add. These are
//!   sync because they run from `Drop` and from the synchronous SSE
//!   completion callback; the Redis impl makes them fire-and-forget.
