//! Prometheus metrics registry shared across the proxy middleware and
//! the admin `/metrics` endpoint.
//!
//! Existing compatibility series cover spec §7:
//! - `aisix_requests_total{provider,model,status,outcome}` — counter
//!   incremented once per proxy request that produced a response. A request
//!   the caller abandoned before the response head never reaches it; see
//!   [`M_PROXY_CLIENT_CANCELLED`].
//! - `aisix_request_duration_seconds{provider,model,status}` — histogram
//!   of proxy latency, recorded when the response is handed to the client.
//!   That is the full request for a non-streamed response and only time to
//!   response START for a streamed one; `aisix_request_e2e_latency_seconds`
//!   is the series that is end-to-end on both. See `request_metrics`.
//! - `aisix_ratelimit_rejections_total{scope}` — counter for 429 flows.
//! - `aisix_tokens_consumed_total{provider,model}` — counter of
//!   `usage.total_tokens` summed across completed calls. Streamed calls are
//!   included: they contribute from the end-of-stream emit, not at response
//!   open like the two series above.
//!
//! Newer AISIX-native series use `aisix_proxy_*` and `aisix_llm_*`
//! names with bounded, DP-stable labels. They intentionally do not
//! copy label names from other LLM gateways that the data plane does
//! not have.
//!
//! A single [`Metrics`] instance is held `Arc`'d inside `ObsState` and
//! cloned into axum state. The exposition format is emitted via
//! `metrics-exporter-prometheus`'s text renderer; no global recorder is
//! installed, so tests can spin up isolated instances per case.

// ── Per-worker handle cache ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `metrics::counter!`-family macros rebuild a `Key` (one owned `String` per
// label), hash it, and probe the recorder's sharded registry on EVERY emit.
// `metrics::Counter`/`Gauge`/`Histogram` are `Arc`-backed handles wired
// straight to the series' storage, so registering once per label set and
// reusing the handle removes all of that from the steady-state path.
//
// The cache is `thread_local!`, not shared: this process runs one
// current-thread runtime per pinned core (thread-per-core), and a shared
// map — like the two `RwLock` caches this replaced — puts one contended
// cache line (the lock word) in front of every emit on every worker. The
// spike for #1259 item 3b measured that shared-lock variant
// recovering almost nothing (+0.5% throughput) while the thread-local
// variant recovered +4.4%; per-worker duplication of a bounded handle set
// is the whole trick.
//
// Correctness properties:
// - Keys are `instance id \x1f site \x1f label values…`, so two `Metrics`
//   instances on one thread (parallel tests) can never serve each other's
//   recorder, and one site's entries can never answer another site.
// - Values never alias: label values are joined with a control byte no
//   bounded label vocabulary contains, and a value that does contain it
//   falls back to the uncached emit instead of being cached.
// - Eviction only drops OUR reference. The series and its value live in
//   the recorder's registry; re-registering the same labels returns a
//   handle to the SAME storage, so counts continue exactly where they
//   left off.

/// FNV-1a, hand-rolled: three instructions per byte, no dependency, and
/// no DoS surface — every byte hashed here is operator-bounded config
/// vocabulary, never attacker-chosen cardinality (#451 keeps raw client
/// strings out of label values by contract).
