//! Helpers shared by every endpoint that needs to dispatch to a Bridge.
//!
//! Every endpoint follows the same shape after Model resolution:
//!
//! 1. Take the resolved `Model` (already looked up by display_name).
//! 2. Resolve the `ProviderKey` it references (via `provider_key_id`).
//! 3. Compute the upstream base URL by combining the `Provider`'s
//!    default with the `ProviderKey`'s optional `api_base` override.
//!
//! These helpers existed inline in each endpoint as
//! `Model::base_url()`, `Model::upstream_model()`, and
//! `Model::provider_config.api_key` accessors. Phase B moved the
//! Model from "self-contained inline secret" to "ProviderKey
//! reference"; this module is the join point that recovers the old
//! ergonomics on the proxy side.
//!
//! Returns typed [`ProxyError`] variants so the caller's `?`
//! plumbing flows naturally.
