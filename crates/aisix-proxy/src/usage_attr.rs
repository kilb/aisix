//! Per-ProviderKey telemetry attribution shared by every request handler's
//! usage-event emitter (AISIX-Cloud#867 + non-chat parity follow-up).
//!
//! The five attribution fields — `provider_kind` / `provider_featured` /
//! `branded_provider` / `pk_label` / `byo_label` — are sourced from the
//! resolved ProviderKey's `telemetry_tags` at emit time. Centralising the
//! snapshot lookup AND the wire-field mapping here keeps the handler family
//! (chat / messages / responses / completions / embeddings / rerank / audio /
//! images) from drifting apart again — the exact bug #867 fixed for
//! `/v1/responses` after it had already been fixed for chat + messages.
//!
//! [`ResolvedPk`] is the second half of that anti-drift move (#941): the
//! attempt's ProviderKey row is looked up ONCE per completion and the
//! result is handed to every terminal emitter, so the metric label and
//! the usage-event attribution can neither disagree nor pay for the same
//! `DashMap` read three times.
